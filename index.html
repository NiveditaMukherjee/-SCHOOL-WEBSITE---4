        <p>Fr. Agnel School perceives all students, as free men and women of our pluralistic society, who through their thought processes and human engagement contribute towards a more integrated, rational, egalitarian and caring society.
 Fr. Agnel School students will grow up to be confident and life-long learners, responsible for their learning, risk-takers and through their positive efforts contribute towards the growth of the community they belong to.
  They will acquire the ability to do complex thinking and problem solving, and thus qualitatively improve products and processes that affect them and their community.
  Fr. Agnel School’s entire educational enterprise will be focused on:
Content             –      what they learn,
Performance     –      what they are able to do,
Engagement      –      how they practice what they learn and influence positively the communities they belong to.
 In order to achieve this goal every member of the faculty and the administrative staff   shall strive to be a critical thinker, use the technology available and optimize the same for pursuing the above goals</p>

        <p>FR. AGNEL SCHOOL was established by the Founding Fathers, with the perspective of building a better India, where every child would grow up to be a man or woman who has the opportunity to pursue his personal potential as a child of God, where he or she learns to respect and love everyone, regardless of community, caste or creed. This belongs to the core belief system of the AGNEL CHARITIES, the promotor Society which is a Christian organization. This selfsame goal of brotherhood (sisterhood), of respect for one and all, and equality of opportunity is also enshrined in our Constitution.

All that the School desires and will do, will be in pursuance of this objective of creating a world where every child will grow up to become a man and woman with a sense of purpose, dignity and a commitment to contribute to the society he or she belongs to. The School will therefore be always driven by this vision to make a better world, where each can grow and reach his or her mental, physical and moral potential as human a being and a citizen of India.

This vision also demands from every individual who is a stake holder in the education of the students, parents, teachers and administrative staff to be sharing this same objective of treating every child as an individual with immense potential and do everything one must do to provide every child the opportunity to grow and blossom.</p>

<h4>FFuturistic School</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In the present environment, the children are going to make a big difference in the way things happen because of their immense influence in the Society at large.

Fr. Agnel School at Noida will be a Green School, which is a unique feature that is being adopted to train children in the conservation and care of the environment. Rain water is being harvested for replenishing underground water level Plastic bags will be completely out of bounds and water heating is done by solar energy alone.

This is an advanced conservation measure and will bring the school students face to face with the hard realities of education for life which is the most important thing students learn during the school years because much that is learnt from books will be supplemented with higher learning, only values being permanent and lasting. Fr. Agnel School children will be pro-active in the field of conservation, social concerns and the future of our earth.</p>

<h4>National Integration</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The institutions run by the Agnel Ashram Fathers are known for their characteristic profile of national integration, which the founders inherited through a very active participation in the freedom struggle of India. The children will be taught to be honest, truthful, and righteous and to excel in whatever they do. The students will be educated to appreciate and love their fellow beings regardless of community, caste and creed, because these constitute the national fiber of India. These sentiments of brotherhood and concern for each other are fundamental to true education and the society that does not care to train their children is doomed to be divided and fall. Social Concern is another important value that the school has and education that is unconcerned about the fate and care of fellow men is incomplete and superficial.

The student of Fr. Agnel School will be taught to go beyond himself/herself to be sensitive and concerned towards others, specially the deprived, weak and the oppressed. The motto of the school will be “Love Your Neighbor as Yourself” which comprises the total universal message that mankind always valued as the ultimate manifestation of God’s presence in the world. This message will be the guiding light in everything that is done in the school.

Technology integration in the classrooms has been our forte for a long time. Our schools in India have been adjudged as the best in Software Development in India-Asia Software Developments contests by Intel and have been awarded several times.

The Noida School is fully wired and it maintains its own intranet as well internet Wi-Fi set up. Each class is equipped with smart boards where teachers use laptops to conduct the class.</p>
